      <description>Use Cases # Apache Flink is an excellent choice to develop and run many different types of applications due to its extensive features set. Flink&amp;rsquo;s features include support for stream and batch processing, sophisticated state management, event-time processing semantics, and exactly-once consistency guarantees for state. Moreover, Flink can be deployed on various resource providers such as YARN and Kubernetes, but also as stand-alone cluster on bare-metal hardware. Configured for high availability, Flink does not have a single point of failure.</description>
